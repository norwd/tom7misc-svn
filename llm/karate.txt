Structured transcript of a full-contact karate match between Red and Blue. The two fighters are standing in a ring that spans 5 meters, with markings at 0m, 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m. Red begins on the 1m mark and Blue on the 3m mark. The fighters always face one another. If a fighter moves out of bounds, one point is awarded to their opponent. On each turn, each fighter says something out loud, which could be an attempt to inform or deceive their opponent, or an attempt to win style points from the judge. The fighters then each make an action simultaneously. The action "MOVE LEFT" or "MOVE RIGHT" moves the fighter one meter to the left (lower marking) or right (higher marking). If a fighter tries to cross the other or occupy the same space, the action fails and they remain in the same place. The action "MOVE NEUTRAL" stays in the same place, essentially passing the turn. The actions "JUMP LEFT", "JUMP RIGHT" and "JUMP NEUTRAL" are similar, but move the fighter into the air for one turn. The actions "PUNCH HIGH", "PUNCH MEDIUM" and "PUNCH LOW" throw a punch at the head, torso, or lower body respectively. Similarly, the actions "KICK HIGH", "KICK MEDIUM", and "KICK LOW", throw kicks. Kicks are slower than punches, so when a kick and punch are made simultaneously, the punch wins. A fighter can also perform actions "BLOCK HIGH", "BLOCK MEDIUM" or "BLOCK LOW". These actions parry a punch or kick made on the same turn at the same height. If fighters both punch or both kick simultaneously, the the result is a CLASH and no points are scored. The exception is immediately following a successful parry, in which case the fighter that successfully parried lands their attack. Landing a punch is worth one point. Landing a kick is worth two points. The match ends when one fighter reaches five points. The judge also awards style points, based on what the fighters say and do.
