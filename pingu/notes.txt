 - TIL that fork() and threads interact badly: Threads are not
   copied to the child process! Because nbdkit forks, this causes
   us beaucoup trouble. The after_fork callback is a good place
   to launch threads, then.
 - nbd-client can time out

Shutdown problems:
 - With --run it seems like the server never actually exits. Not sure
   what the deal is. (Because the client is backgrounded?)


Seems that pings are throttled somewhere. When we set different
max_outstanding values in pingy.exe, we get vastly different success
rates. Linux has some ICMP throttling but it seems to be only
enabled for some types of packets.

See /proc/sys/net/ipv4:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 18 18:35 icmp_msgs_burst
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 18 18:33 icmp_msgs_per_sec
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 18 18:33 icmp_ratelimit
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jan 18 18:16 icmp_ratemask

See source code implementing the throttling:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/net/ipv4/icmp.c


Probably it is upstream routers doing this?
It affects video calls sharing the same connection but from a different
computer, so it's unlikely to be something linux is doing locally.
This probably also explains why it's so lossy on VPN, too.

Traffic is pretty bursty on the host OS's network graph. Throttling
may help a lot here?
