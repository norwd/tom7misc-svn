viewping.exe                    Tom 7          15 Apr 2022

Quick troubleshooting:
 - Needs 64-bit Windows
 - Needs a lot of RAM
 - Make sure to unzip oping.7z


This is a program for viewing the results of pinging the IPv4 address
space, which I did in early 2022. See tom7.org/harder for a writeup
and video (including some other projects). If you use this for
something, consider citing the paper or linking to the site. :)

This program expects to find files called pingX.dat for X in 0..255 in
the current directory. You could try to generate those by pinging the
internet yourself (using ../oping/pingy.exe) or maybe you got them
with this program. You might need to uncompress them with 7zip. They
total 4.2GB so they're too big for me to host permanently. :(

For the same reason, this program needs a lot of RAM; the full size
image is stored as RGBA (4.2B * 32 bits = 16 GB) and it also stores
"mipmaps" for efficient zooming (maybe another ~16 GB). It requires
a 64-bit machine to address that much data.

In the color version, yellow is a fast response (low latency) and cyan
is a slow one (up to 4s). The color ramp is not linear. Black
means that no response was received before the timeout (or it had the
wrong data). I would not take the latencies too seriously, because I
sent pings from two different data centers in the US, and many
confounding factors can affect latency (e.g. time of day that the ping
was sent).

After it loads, hold the left mouse button and drag to pan around,
and use the mousewheel to scroll. The 's' key will save the (full)
current zoom level as a png file, although it refuses to do this
for zoom level 0, which would probably crash. You can make the
resulting PNG file much smaller by reducing its color space (4bpp
is a decent choice) and recompressing with something like optipng;
the PNG export code is not tuned for high compression.
