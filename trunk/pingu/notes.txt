 - TIL that fork() and threads interact badly: Threads are not
   copied to the child process! Because nbdkit forks, this causes
   us beaucoup trouble. The after_fork callback is a good place
   to launch threads, then.
 - nbd-client can time out

Shutdown problems:
 - With --run it seems like the server never actually exits. Not sure
   what the deal is. (Because the client is backgrounded?)
