This is code (experimental, obviously) for several weird block devices
("hard drives"). See the video and paper at tom7.org/harder for an
introduction.

Note this whole thing is super insecure, for many reasons!
Don't run it on a system you care about!

 - unix domain socket has the wrong permissions

Compiling is something like this (from memory):
 - Get nbdkit (source) and compile it (in ../../nbdkit).
 - Install nbd-client too

make -j        (compile the .so plugins in this directory)
make -C viz    (compile the optional visualizations)

Modify run.sh to select the plugin you want, and the size.
sudo ./run.sh

You can then run
sudo ./benchmark.exe /mnt/[somedrive] file
to execute the simple benchmark.

# drop disk caches
sync && echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
