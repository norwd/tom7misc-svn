oping.* and liboping.* are a heavily modified code from liboping.
GPL licensed. See ../LICENSE.

pingy.cc pings a large block of the ipv4 address space. You need to
customize the main function and recompile to tell it what part to
ping, and you probably also want to tweak the throttling constants at
the top. Or just look at the graphic I made of the whole internet in
the paper at tom7.org/harder/.

You should be able to run this on a 2022 Ubuntu system by just installing
gcc 10:

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt install g++-10 subversion make emacs-nox
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-10 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-10 10
sudo apt autoremove
sudo apt autoclean
svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/tom7misc/svn/trunk sf_svn
cd sf_svn/pingu/oping
make -j

If you ping the whole internet, you can view the results with the
code in ../viewping.

The dat files are very sparse, and the PNGs only have minimal compression.
Save yourself metered bandwidth: use sftp -C for compression
