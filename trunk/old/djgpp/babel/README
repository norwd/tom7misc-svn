I think this was part of a joke on our site snoot.com, based on the
old translation website Babel Fish (AltaVista!). The idea was that you
could translate any web page on snoot.com into one of its supported
languages, which were Latin (replaces u with v) and Yoda (shuffles the
words randomly). Not sure if it was ever actually live?
