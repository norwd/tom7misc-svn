This is a test cartridge for the NES, intended for emulator
development. It exercises some undocumented 6502 instructions that
didn't have coverage in other NES ROMs that I have, and then displays
the first half of RAM on-screen. The idea is that if the instructions
are implemented incorrectly, the RAM and screenshot will be incorrect.
See reset.s for some details.

Use and distribute freely.
