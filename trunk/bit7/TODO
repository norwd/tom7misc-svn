Check mark:
On windows we get some glyph substitution for unicode characters that
have become emojis (even if they are in the font), which I think is bad
for FixederSys. From a brief look, it seems like we may need to mark the
font somehow to indicate that it supports some "emoji". Supposedly
"Segoe UI Symbol" does this, whereas "Segoe UI Emoji" has the color
emoji in it.
